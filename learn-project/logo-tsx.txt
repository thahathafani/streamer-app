logo.tsx

What is it?

This file is like the banner or flag of your castle. 
It represents your app's identity and gives it a recognizable face.


What's happening here?

Imports:

"Image": Used to display images in Next.js, like adding a picture or logo to your castle.
"Poppins": A font from Google Fonts that makes your castle's text look neat and stylish.
"cn": A utility function to combine class names. It's like mixing LEGO pieces of different colors to create a unique look.
Logo Component:

Font Setup: You’re loading the Poppins font with different weights (like thin and bold pieces of LEGO bricks) to use throughout your app.
Rendering the Logo:

The Logo component builds the logo display for your app.
"Image": There’s an empty src for the image, where you can put the URL or path to your logo file. 
         This image is placed inside a circle with some padding (like framing a picture).
"Text": Below the image, there’s some text:
"Streamer": The main title in a big, bold font.
"let's Stream Now": A subtitle in a smaller, lighter color font, like a catchphrase.

What to do next?

Add your logo's image source (URL or file path) to the src="" attribute to display it in your app.
