export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col gap-y-4">
      <h1>Home</h1>
    </div>
  );
}


>> This is for the home page(primary page of a website). This page is not completely build,
    but its just a sample development now.

        <div> is like a box or container. This container has a few styles applied:

           # flex tells it to be flexible and adjust its size depending on the content.
           # flex-col means that any items inside the div should be stacked vertically, one on top of another.
           # gap-y-4 means there is space between these items (4 units of space).
           # Inside the div, there is an <h1> tag, which is used to show a heading. In this case, it shows the word "Home".
    
    Use Case:

            This component would be used when you want to show a basic home page with a "Home" title.



Detailed Breakdown:

    Function Component Syntax:

        # export default function Page() {} is how we define a functional component in React.
        # Page is the name of the function and represents the entire home page component. Itâ€™s being exported by default, meaning this is the main function in this file.

    JSX (HTML-like Structure):

        # Inside the function, we return JSX, which looks like HTML but is actually JavaScript syntax designed to describe the UI structure.
        # <div>: This is a container element. It acts as a box that can hold other elements.

            # className="flex flex-col gap-y-4": This is how you apply CSS classes in React. Let's break down these classes:
                
                # flex: This enables Flexbox, a CSS layout system that helps align items in a container.
                # flex-col: This makes Flexbox arrange the items in a column (vertical direction).
                # gap-y-4: This adds vertical spacing between the children inside the Flexbox container (i.e., between the <h1> tag and any future elements).
        # <h1>Home</h1>: This is a header, one of the largest text elements used to define a main heading. The word "Home" will be displayed in large text.

    Visual Output:

        # When this component is rendered on the screen, it will display the word "Home" in large, bold text, and any additional content can be added later under it with appropriate spacing.
