export default function Page() {

      <h1>Home</h1>
    </div>
  );
}


>> This is for the home page(primary page of a website). This page is not completely build,
    but its just a sample development now.

        <div> is like a box or container. This container has a few styles applied:

           # flex tells it to be flexible and adjust its size depending on the content.
           # flex-col means that any items inside the div should be stacked vertically, one on top of another.
           # gap-y-4 means there is space between these items (4 units of space).
           # Inside the div, there is an <h1> tag, which is used to show a heading. In this case, it shows the word "Home".
    
    Use Case:
    
            This component would be used when you want to show a basic home page with a "Home" title.
