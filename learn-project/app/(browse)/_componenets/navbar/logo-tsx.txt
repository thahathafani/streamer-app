import Image from "next/image";
import Link from "next/link";
import { Poppins } from "next/font/google";

const font = Poppins({
    subsets: ["latin"],
    weight: ["200","300","400", "500", "600", "700", "800"],
});

export const Logo = () => {
    return (
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center gap-y-4">
            <div className="bg-white rounded-full p-1">
                <Image src="" alt="streamer-app" height="80" />
            </div>
            <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
                <p className="text-2xl font-semibold">Streamer</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
};


Explanation:

    Logo Structure:

        # The Poppins font is imported and applied to text.
        # Image Tag: This is used to display the logo image, but the source URL is currently empty (src=""), meaning no image will show yet.
        # Text "Streamer": Below the image, there is a text with the app’s name ("Streamer"), styled to look large and bold.

    Use Case:

        This component would show the app’s logo and name at the top of the website, giving it a recognizable brand identity.
