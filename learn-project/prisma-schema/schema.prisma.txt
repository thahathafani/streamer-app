Purpose:

This file defines your database schema, like a blueprint for your database structure.
Key Models:

User:

Represents a user in your application.
Fields include id, externalUserId, username, imageUrl, email, bio, and timestamps.
Relations: Users can follow and be followed by others (through the Follow model).
Follow:

Represents the follow relationship between users.
Fields include id, followerId, followingId, and timestamps.
It includes unique constraints and indexes to efficiently manage these relationships.
Usage:

These models are used by Prisma to generate the database tables/collections and the corresponding TypeScript types. Your services (auth-service.ts, user-service.ts, recommended-service.ts) interact with these models through the db client.
