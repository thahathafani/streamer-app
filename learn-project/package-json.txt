This file is like the instruction manual for your project. 
It lists all the tools and libraries the project needs and
the commands to run it.

"name": "streamer-app" – This is the name of your project.
"build": "next build" – This command prepares your project for production.
"start": "next start" – This runs the built project, ideal for production.
"lint": "next lint" – This checks your code for errors or code style issues.

dependencies: These are the tools the project needs to run:

@clerk/nextjs, @prisma/client, mongodb, mongoose, react, next, etc. 
– These libraries are required for user authentication, connecting to 
a MongoDB database, building UI components, and running the Next.js framework.

devDependencies: These are the tools needed during development (not in production):

"eslint" – A tool that checks code for errors.
"tailwindcss" – A utility-based CSS framework for styling the app.
"typescript" – A superset of JavaScript that adds types to the code.
