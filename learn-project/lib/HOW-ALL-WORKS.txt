How It All Fits Together

1. Authentication:

When a user logs in, auth-service.ts checks if they exist in your database and returns their details.

2. User Data Management:

user-service.ts allows you to retrieve users by their username, which is essential for features like viewing user profiles.

3. Recommendations:

recommended-service.ts provides a list of users that could be recommended for following, enhancing user engagement.

4. Database Operations:

All interactions with your MongoDB database are handled via the PrismaClient defined in db.ts.

5. Database Schema:

The schema.prisma file defines the structure of your data, ensuring consistency and reliability in how data is stored and retrieved.



                            Next Steps

Expand Functionality: Depending on your appâ€™s needs, you might want to add more services or extend existing ones, such as handling user updates or deleting follow relationships.

Front-End Integration: Connect these back-end services to your front-end, ensuring a seamless user experience.
