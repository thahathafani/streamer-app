Purpose:

This service provides a list of recommended users, likely for features like suggesting users to follow.
Key Functions:

getRecommended:
This function first tries to get the current logged-in user (self).
If a user is found, it fetches other users from the database, excluding the current user.
If no user is logged in, it fetches all users.
The users are sorted by createdAt in descending order, meaning the newest users are listed first.
Usage:

This could be used on a "Suggested Users" page or a similar feature in your app.
