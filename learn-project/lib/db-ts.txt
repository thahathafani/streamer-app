Purpose:

This file manages your connection to the database. It's like the bridge connecting your app to your database.

Key Concepts:

PrismaClient:
This is your database client, generated by Prisma, which provides an easy and type-safe way to interact with your database.
Global Declaration:
The global variable prisma ensures that a single instance of PrismaClient is reused throughout your app, which is important for avoiding issues during development.
Usage:

Any database operations (like finding or creating records) are done through this db instance.
