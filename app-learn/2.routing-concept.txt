In NextJs the routing is a helps to manage the file stactuter as well as page redidection method without refreshing the complete webpage.

    1. How do we know that the "page.tsx" is the root file to shown on the localhost:3000?
    2. Why its only choosen the "page.tsx" as the root?

    To answer this we have,

        The "page.tsx" is indide of the "app" folder. The "app" folder is specially reserved folder in the NextJs.
        The 2nd thing is that this file is named as "page.tsx",the page is a reserved filename in NextJs.
         Itâ€™s tells the router this the file we need to show to the clients.

         -> In a folder "app" there is a page.tsx(extention doesn't matter on file name matters) it will be the "route".
         -> But if there is another file called foo.tsx inside the "app" this wouldn't be a route.


        So how could we work for multiple page?
