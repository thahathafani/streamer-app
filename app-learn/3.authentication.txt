Here we are going to create a authentication page for both signin and registration.

For authentication we gone use the Clerk auth.
The Clerk auth is usefull for authentication, which helps to make authentication in some steps.

    Steps for authentication:

        1. Signin to Clerk
        2. Click add application
        3. Name the application and select the auth methods(email,username,phone number) want.
        4. Click create application
        5. Copy the environment keys from the api keys and paste it into .env
        6. before going to paste it on .env (if we not add .env in gitignore: it effects the privacy):
                1. Go to .gitignore
                2. Move to "# local env files" in .gitignore
                3. add ".env" there
                4. At root of the project create a ".env" file.
                5. paste the copyied api key from "Clerk".

            code: 
                .env

                    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=key-here
                    CLERK_SECRET_KEY=key-here

        Now we done everything, but the clerk doesn't have access to the project:

            So moving to the Docs in clerk: Add authentication and user management to your NextJs App with clerk
            

            So we need to install the Clerk inside the project

                1. "npm i @clerk/nextjs" on terminal
                2. Now set the env keys: we already did that.
                3. Now we need to wrap our project with "<clerkprovider></clerkprovider>"
                4. To wrap the project: as i know that the "layout" is the major point where i need to do the complete project layout things
