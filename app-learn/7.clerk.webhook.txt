Now we are going to work with the webhook with clerk.

    So to setup the webhook, we need to make the connection between the clerk and the internet conection.

    To setup:

        1. Go to webhooks in the clerk:
        2. Add new webhook
        3. Now the endpoints paste the ngrok urls:
        4. At the end of the url add this: "/api/webhooks/clerk" - this is very important
        5. On the message filtering go and select user and add: user.create,user.deleted,user.updated
        6. And click create.

Now thw connection build but its not complete until the signing secret key is added to the .env

    Copy the signing key and paste it on the .env:

        .env:

            CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET="secret key here!"
