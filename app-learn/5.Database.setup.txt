So we are setuped the Clerk authentication.
If the user register in the app the clerk add the details to the system, but we didn't know what goin on the clerk database without connecting our's, So that settup the user db to ourown db.

To do that we need to settup the database seprately with webhook support from the clerk.

    To setup that we need to setup the Database 1st.

        In this project i planned to added the mongodb-atlas database with prisma:



So here i want to make a connection between the database and the app.

    Now create a db on mongodb atlas:
        copy the atlas url, and paste it on the .env file:

            code:

                .env:

                    DATABASE_URL="key here"

    Now install the couple of packages here:

           1. "npm i -D prisma" 
           2. "npm i @prisma/client"
           3. "npx i prisma init"

    Now there will be a schema.prisma inside the prisma folder.

        Code:

            prisma/schema.prisma:

                generator client {
                provider = "prisma-client-js"
                }

                datasource db {
                provider = "mongodb"
                url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
                }

    Now we want to push the db.

        "npx prisma db push" - if here gets any error: we need to added the model on the db:

        So i'am gone make a user model over lib/db.ts:

        Code:

            lib/db.ts:

            model User {
            id    String @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
            username  String @unique
            imageUrl String @db.String
            email String @unique
            externalUserId String @unique
            bio String? @db.String

            createdAt DateTime @default(now())
            updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
            }

    This will works properly.

    Now we want to push the db.

        "npx prisma db push".

    To add the db in local env.

        "npx prisma generate"

    This will push the atlas db to the prisma.

        Now run "npx prisma studio"

    To check out the prisma in the localhost:5555


So we setup the database with connected to the prisma.
