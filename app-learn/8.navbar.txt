Now we are going to work with the app ui part: navbar

Here the app navigation is goining to be designed.

So now i am going to make a folder named: (browse) inside the app folder and create an another folder named "(home)".

    Inside the (home) the "page"(from the root of app folder) is drag and droped into the (home).

    So the page file inside the (home) folder is just an home page of the app, nothing changed.
