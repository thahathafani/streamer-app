Now we are going to work with the app ui part: navbar

Here the app navigation is goining to be designed.

So now i am going to make a folder named: (browse) inside the app folder and create an another folder named "(home)".

    Inside the (home) the "page"(from the root of app folder) is drag and droped into the (home).

    So the page file inside the (home) folder is just an home page of the app, nothing changed.


    So inside of the (browse) folder,we ar going to create a seprate folder named "_components", and create "navbar" folder for creating seprate entry for the component, and create an a intex.tsx inside the "navbar".

        Code:

                app/(browse)/_component/navbar/index.tsx:

                    import React from 'react'
                    import { Logo } from './logo'
                    import { Search } from './search'
                    import Actions from './actions'

                    function Navbar() {
                    return (
                        <nav className='fixed top-0 w-full h-20 z-[49] bg-[#272932] px-2 lg:px-4 flex justify-between items-center shadow-sm'>
                            {/* <Logo/> */}
                            <Search/>
                            <Actions />
                        </nav>
                    )
                    }

                    export default Navbar

        Okay now the navbar component is done but we need to make much more attractive navbar:
