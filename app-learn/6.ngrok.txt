Now we are going to connect the localhost to the internet.

Here we are testing to check the connection between the internet.

So we are using Ngrok to connect the app to the internet.

    terminal:

            ngrok

            :success message

            "ngrok config add-authtoken "key here" "

            Now the authtoken is connected with the configration file.

            Now run "ngrok http 3000"

            before running this make sure localhost is running.

        it will create a url for internet search.

        but the issue is, the for everytime we restart the terminal, we get an different url everytime. to make a constant url,
         we have to work over the fixed url option by the ngrok.

            To make a stable url:

                1. go to ngrok and select "domain" in the "cloud edge".
                2. copy the link on the start a tunnel.
                3. Paste it on the terminal.
                4. Now we have our own url: which will be same forever.

So the Local tunnel is setted very well, with the connection through the internet.
