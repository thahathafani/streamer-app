Now we are going to work on the dark mode and auth logo:

For that 1st of all we gone recharge the complete globals.css for keeping css completely standardized.

Now we need to create an component folder inside of the (auth), but before that we have to settup the components folder as in _components. 

    The "_" means as don't even put it in the router.
    The "_" name after it doesn't matters, even if you put the "_page.tsx" it will not be renderd on the router.

So after that create a "logo.ts" inside the "_components".


    Code: logo.ts:

        import Image from "next/image";
        import { Poppins } from "next/font/google";

        const font = Poppins({
            subsets: ["latin"],
            weight: ["200","300","400", "500", "600", "700", "800"],
        });

        export const Logo = () => {
            return(
                <div className="flex flex-col items-center gap-y-4">
                    <div className="bg-white rounded-full p-1">
                        <Image 
                        src=""
                        alt="streamer-app"
                        height="80"
                        />
                    </div>
                    <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
                        <p className="text-2xl font-semibold">
                            Streamer
                        </p>
                        <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground">
                            let's Stream Now
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            );
        };


        Now the logo is setted very well, but we have to use the components to the layout of the auth,
         for that we have to add the components logo to the auth layout.

         import the logo 1st: 
         
            import { Logo } from "./_components/logo"
            This before the children: <Logo />

Now we added the Logo to the auth and they are working smoothly:
